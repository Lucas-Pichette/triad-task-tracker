This is a fully serverless tool, with all dependencies (at least those made by myself), being fully serverless.  
  
Due to lack of time, the component specs/tests aren't as verbose as I'd like, but I'm glad I was able to focus and complete a lot of the DevOps environment that I had wanted to.  
  
The website itself is made using Angular, tests are done with Karma, and Continuous Integration is done using GitHub Actions, and Continuous Deployment is also done using GitHub Actions.  
  
Thank you for actually reading the README.md, haha.
